                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a powerful tool and is 
                    used by practically every site on the internet.
                    Because of its ubiquity and power, we will be building our demos
                    with it!
                </p>
                <h3>Tags in HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML uses <b>tags</b> to format text.
                    For example, 
                        <code>&lt;b&gt;</code><b>this text is in bold,</b><code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>
                        but the following text is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tags tell browsers what to do with the text inside of them.
                    <code>&lt;tag_name_here&gt;</code> starts a tag named "tag_name_here"
                    and <code>&lt;/tag_name_here&gt;</code> ends the tag! Let's see 
                    some examples!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code><b>This text is in bold!</b><code>&lt;/b&gt;</code></li>
                    <li><code>&lt;i&gt;</code><i>This text is in italics!</i><code>&lt;/i&gt;</code></li>
                    <li><code>&lt;u&gt;</code><u>This text has been underlined!</u><code>&lt;/u&gt;</code></li>
                    <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code><p>This text is considered a separate 
                        paragraph! It gets its own line!</p><code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Try using them in the editor below!
                </p>
                <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "off">
<p>Bold this text!</p>
<p><i>Un-italicize this text!</i></p>
<p><u>Un-underline this text!</u></p>
<p>
    Paragraphs can be put on their own 
    line here (in the Editor view), 
    but they don't have to be. 
    The web-browser, knowing what 
    paragraphs are, shows their content
    on a separate line!
</p>
<p>
    Notice 
    that additional line breaks

    here are 


    shown by the browser as spaces!

     display its contents.

                <p>
                    Notice the text surrounded by <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>
                    above, when in the Editor tab. That text is in a <b>comment</b>! It will not be displayed as a part
                    of the website.

            </div>


            <div id = "settingUpTheDocument">
                <h3>Setting up the Document</h3>
                <p>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> starts
                    our documents â€” it tells the web browser that 
                    we are, in fact, using HTML (instead of something like XHTML).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though we tell web browsers that we intend to use 
                    HTML by starting our documents with 
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, we can put things that 
                    are not HTML in an HTML document (like JavaScript). As such,
                    we need the <code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code> tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code> tag
                    surrounds the contents of the document -- it surrounds
                    all of our HTML. The <code>&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</code>
                    tag is used to mark the website's content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</code> tag 
                    surrounds information related to parts of the website
                    outside the page. For example, 
                    <code>&lt;title&gt; sets the page's title
                         to this text! &lt;/title&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Browsers use the <code>&lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;</code>
                    to show people using the website which page is which by,
                    for example, putting this text at the top of the screen,
                    in a tab label.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an example:

                <p>
                    We will be using JavaScript to make our simulations
                    act as they should. To run JavaScript, we can put it
                    inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag!
                </p>

                <b>Some Quick Information</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Math!</b> JavaScript can evaluate expressions like <code>5*43 + 2.6</code>.</li>
                    <li><b>Variables!</b> We can make new variables using 
                        <code>let varname = initialValue</code> and change 
                        the value of an existing variable like this: 
                        <code>varname = newValue</code>. 
                        For example, <code>varname = (varname + 1) / 2</code>
                        sets a variable named <code>varname</code> to the average
                        of its old value and <code>1</code>. It is important to note
                        that we are <b>setting</b> <code>varname</code> to the result
                        of an expression on <b>the old value of varname</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>IDs in HTML!</b> We can give HTML tags <b>id</b>entifires so that we
                            can access their contents through JavaScript. For example,
                            we could associate &ldquo;anId&rdquo; with a paragraph like 
                            this: 
                            <code>
                                &lt;p id="anId"&gt;Contents of the paragraph... 
                                &lt;/p&gt;</code>
                            Note that anId is in quotation marks. This keeps the 
                            contents of <code>id</code> separate from any other 
                            properties we might want to give the paragraph (we'll
                            see more of these later). 
                            We can use single (') or
                            double (") quotes. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                        
                <b>JavaScript Comments!</b>

                    <b>Changing Text!</b>
                    <p>
                        To change text, we need to be able to let JavaScript know 
                        what we want to change. To do this, we give JavaScript a 
                        <b>selector</b>. This might be the name of a tag (like the
                        "p" in a <code>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</code>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things we can change are part of the HTML <code>document</code>. 
                        To query and use them, we give JavaScript a selector. We can specify it
                        like this: <code>document.querySelector("p")</code> 
                        queries a <code>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</code>
                        from the document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that we put "p" in quotation marks in the selector --
                        this tells JavaScript that "p" isn't the name of a variable, it
                        represents the text, <code>p</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We write <code>let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p")</code> to 
                        get the first <code>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</code> paragraph and store it
                        in the new variable <code>aParagraph.</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More generally, <code>document.querySelector("p")</code> gets the paragraph
                        and <code>let aParagraph = </code> makes the new variable, <code>aParagraph</code>,
                        and sets it.
                    </p>

        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>

            <p>Notice that we set the <code>textContent</code> of
               the paragraph just like we set a variable! We can 
               use <code>textContent</code> just like other variables!</p>

                    we don't do this, JavaScript assumes we are are refering to
                    a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to set the text of <code>aParagraph</code>

                <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "false">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Setting Text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>A paragraph...</p>
        <script>
            let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
            aParagraph.textContent = "This is the new content!";
        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>

            <p>
                We can join two strings together with the <code>+</code>
                operator. For example, <code>"some text" + " joined with even more"</code>
                is equivalent to <code>"some text joined with even more"</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                From here, I will call HTML tags and their contents "elements" -- "tag"
                is specific to the text between <code>&lt;these brackets&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, we can add additional text to an element by setting 
                adding text to its <code>textContent</code>. For example,
                <code>aParagraph.textContent = aParagraph.textContent 
                                + " with new text";</code>
                adds the text " with new text" to the end of the contents of
                <code>aParagraph</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding text on to the end of existing text (appending it)
                is so common that JavaScript lets us write
                <code>aParagraph.textContent += " with new text"</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This shorthand is equivalent to writing out <code>aParagraph.textContent = aParagraph.textContent 
                    + " with new text"</code>, but it is easier to read and type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see an example!
            </p>
            <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "false">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>More Setting Text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>A paragraph...</p>
        <script>
            let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
            aParagraph.textContent 
                    += " that now also has this content. ";
            aParagraph.textContent 
                    += "This text is added to the end. ";
            aParagraph.textContent = aParagraph.textContent 
                    + " This is another way to add text to the"
                    + " paragraph. "
                    + "It is a bit more difficult to type, "
                    + "however.";
            aParagraph.textContent += ' These strings can be'
                    + ' in either single or double quotes.';
        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>
            </div>
            <div id = "changingHTML">
                <h3>Changing HTML with JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    Although we can use <code>element.textContent</code>
                    to change the text of an element, we can't use it to
                    make new elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's see what happens when we try!
                </p>
                <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "false">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Setting Text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>A paragraph...</p>
        <script>
            let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
            aParagraph.textContent = "<i>Will this text ";
            aParagraph.textContent += "be in <b>italics?</b></i>";
        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>
            <p>
                We can, instead, change the <code>element.innerHTML</code>!
            </p>
            <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "false">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Setting Text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>A paragraph...</p>
        <script>
            let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
            aParagraph.innerHTML = "<i>Will this text ";
            aParagraph.innerHTML += "be in <b>italics?</b></i>";
        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>
            <p>
                <b><i>What?!</i></b> Only part of the text was italicized! 
                Only the text we added with 
                <code>aParagraph.innerHTML = "&lt;<i>i</i>&gt;Will this text "</code>
                was put in italics!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because each time we set <code>element.innerHTML</code>,
                the browser expects the new <code>innerHTML</code> to only contain
                complete elements. It updates the page just after you set the HTML 
                (but it might take some time for you to be able to see it).
            </p>
            <p>
                We can do it like this instead:
            </p>
            <textarea class = "code" autocomplete = "false">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Setting Text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>A paragraph...</p>
        <script>
            let aParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
            aParagraph.innerHTML = "<i>Will this text " 
                                 + "be in <b>italics?</b></i>";
        </script>
    </body>
</html></textarea>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
