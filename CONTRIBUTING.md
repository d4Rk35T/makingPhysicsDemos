# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This tutorial is far from complete.

## Getting started

### Create an Issue (Optional)

Before submitting a pull request, I suggest you [create an issue](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/makingPhysicsDemos/issues/new) to let others know that the problem exists and you are working on it. 

If you do this, please provide a link to the fork of the project and a description of the changes made so far!

### Fork the Project

To submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), you will want to have forked the project. 

Do this by clicking the `Fork` button at the top right of this project's GitHub page.

**Note:** This project relies on a submodule. See `README.md` for cloning instructions.

### Draft a Pull Request

A pull request might look like this:

Title: `Improve Clarity of CONTRIBUTING.md`
Description:
```
CONTRIBUTING.md is currently difficult to understand for 
users new to Git and GitHub. This pull request aims to make
it easier to understand.

List of Changes:
  * Added a `Community Guidelines` section.
  * Added step-by-step instructions describing how to fork the project.
  * Include detailed cloning instructions.
```

You may then request a review of your pull request by users with write access to this repository. Be prepared to make changes!
